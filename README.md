Buckshot Roulette Decomp
---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This has not been debugged because I have better things to do than debug in binary :)

## To run:
  1. Buy a copy of Buckshot Roulette [HERE](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette)
  2. Unpack ```scenes/main.tscn.zip``` (It was too big to push normally)
  3. Run ```project.godot``` using Godot Version ```4.4.4-dev```

Disclaimer

I do not own or operate Buckshot Roulette (I OWN A COPY OF BOTH THE ITCH AND STEAM VERSION, FYI), and this repo is purely for educational purposes and for people that have bought a licence.
