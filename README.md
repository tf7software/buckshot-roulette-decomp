Buckshot Roulette Decomp
---

## To run:
  1. Buy a copy of Buckshot Roulette [HERE](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette)
  2. Unpack ```scenes/main.tscn.zip``` (It was too big to push normally)
  3. Run ```project.godot``` using Godot Version ```4.4.4-dev```

I do not own or operate Buckshot Roulette, and this repo is purely for Educational purposes and for people that have bought a licence.
